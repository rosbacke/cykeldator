The bike computer uses an 1.3" monocrome Oled display for output.
It got 128x64 pixels. With support software we can write text to arbitrary positions.

The display is divided into 3 verical section1:
1: top row. Status information. e.g. battery, mode active etc.
2: main row : Main display value. Typically speed.
3: bottom row: sec display. Typically ride distance or total distance.

We have 2 buttons. Each can detect short / long push, giving 4 different events.

Status row: battery status, calculation quality, logging active, UI mode. speed unit, length unit.

Use ',' for decimal separator, ' for 1000 separator.

Basic display modes:

Speed: (spd)
1 : Statusrow
2 : Speed, 2.1 digits.
3 : (Trip distance, m) (total dist, km)

Distance : (dist)
